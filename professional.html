                I've been working in customer service since i was 16. I've picked up a great number of skills since I started working at my first job as a customer service representative at Pizza Hut dispatch.
                Working here was a challenge becuase I really didn't know much about customer service at all. We (the employees) were evaluated on the speed and efficiency at which we took calls and I caught on quickly.
                I stayed at that job for about 2 years before I moved away to take my first stab at college at Hinds Community College as a Music Education Major.

            <p>
                I was lucky enough to be one of the first few classes to spend my entire high school career at Ridgeland High School. While I was there I was a part o several different programs.
                I was in theatre, where I played piano for the school musical (Grease). I also attened a few semesters of Theatre class where I actually got a chance to write and direct my own plays. Honestly, this was
                one of my favorite things to do in that class. Especially when I was given the chance to have one of my school crushes act out one of the parts! lol
                <br>
                I wanted to participate in several different programs but the one that played the biggest role in my High School career and my post high school life was band. At this poin in my educational career, I had been in band
                for 4 years already (since 6th grade), But transferring to High School Marching / Concert band felt like transistioning to the big leagues. I was almost immediately given a "section leader" title because of my
                piano knowledge and experience from earlier in life though I felt a bit unqualified. I leaned a lot on those who had been there before me to make sure that I checked all the boxes as far a being a good section leader was concerned.

                This was the start of my college career. I started attending hinds community college in fall of 2008. At the time I was after an associates degree in Music Eductaion.
                While i was here I got deeply invested in the music department. At first i was just in the Marching Band for the fall and the concert band in the spring. By the end of my 4th semester, though, i was in
                the marching band, 2 concert bands, jazz band, 3 rock bands, and 'garage band'. It was quite a load and I had a lot of trouble balancing this load with my other academic classes.
                Ultimately, in 2011, I decided to stop taking classes and join the military.

                After spending some time in the work force, I decided that going away for school would be the best course of action when it came to bettering myself. I left and started work on my
                bachelors in Computer Science. I left home and moved in to my apartment in 2016 and completed my degree in 2021. When I left, i had completed my degree in computer Science and I had also earned
                an information assurance professional certificate.
